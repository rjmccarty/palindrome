Updating node:

(Node 12 installed on system where I ran this.)

To run:

palindrome.js has a shebang in it and can be simply run interpretively by directly executing the file:

./palindrome.js

The file can also be renamed to simply "palindrome", or a symlink can
be created so the .js extension isn't need to run it. To create a
symlink:

    ln -s palindrome.js palindrome
