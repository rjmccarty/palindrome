Solutions are here for the following languages:

C
C++
Lisp
Fortran
Cobol
Pascal
Algol68
Go
JavaScript (Node)

(I added C++, Go and JavaScript as a bonus, even though they don't
exactly fit into the vintage language category.)

Was an interesting exercise. I learned a few things. One being
surprised how short the Cobol version was. Another was confirming my
lack of enthusiasm for C++. Another was confirming my enthusiasm for
Go and Lisp. I also found Pascal to be enjoyable, while Algol was less
than satisfying.

I also started working on Erlang and Prolog, but quickly decided to
give up while I was ahead. There are some file reading examples there
in case anyone would like to take those on.
