To run:

helloworld.a68 has a shebang in it and can be simply run interpretively by directly executing the file:

./helloworld.a68

The file can also be renamed to simply "helloworld", or a symlink can be created so the .a68 extension isn't need to run it. To create a symlink:

    ln -s helloworld.a68 helloworld

An optimized version can be created with the following:

   a68g -O ./helloworld.a68
